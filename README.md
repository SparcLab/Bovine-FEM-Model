# Bovine-FEM-Model
Model of a bovine for Finite Element Method based analysis for in-body to out-of-body communication in farm animals.  
Smart animal agriculture is enabling animals to be part of Internet of Things (IOT) space generating huge data from various sensors which when analyzed can enhance farm productivity. Data received from sensors dwelling inside the rumen can monitor rumen health and prevent diseases like sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in cow’s preventing huge losses in the dairy industry and thus propelling efficient animal agriculture.

A method of accurately modeling the morphological features of the cow’s body for path loss studies using FEM based simulations is done to generate the bovine model.In order to precisely model the morphological traits of the animal under study, a series of experiments were conducted where RGB-D (Realsense D435i) and stereo cameras (Zed Stereo Camera) were used to conduct 360° scans of the animal.

The 3D CAD model is provided in IGES and STEP formats. The model will be updated with additional layers with more detail to model the anatomy of the animal for studies with higher accuracy. The PNG file shows a 2D view of the model with the dimensions. 
The rumen is a dynamic environment with particles inside in motion due to repeated contractions and expansions of the ruminal walls. The motion of the ruminal walls is tracked using depth sensitive cameras (Intel RealSense D435i). These images captured with depth sensitive cameras are color coded with red showing walls close to the camera and blue are the walls which are further away. The images show the movement of ruminal walls. Further, the contents inside the rumen are present in a stratified form with the top layer formed by gases, a middle layer formed by a dense mat of fibers and a bottom layer consisting of clear liquid.
