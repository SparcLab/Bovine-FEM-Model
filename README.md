# Bovine-FEM-Model
Model of a bovine for Finite Element Method based analysis for in-body to out-of-body communication in farm animals.  
Smart animal agriculture is enabling animals to be part of Internet of Things (IOT) space generating huge data from various sensors which when analyzed can enhance farm productivity. Data received from sensors dwelling inside the rumen can monitor rumen health and prevent diseases like sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in cow’s preventing huge losses in the dairy industry and thus propelling efficient animal agriculture.

A method of accurately modeling the morphological features of the cow’s body for path loss studies using FEM based simulations is done to generate the bovine model.In order to precisely model the morphological traits of the animal under study, a series of experiments were conducted where RGB-D (Realsense D435i) and stereo cameras (Zed Stereo Camera) were used to conduct 360° scans of the animal.
